  # Welcome to GraphiQL
  #
  # GraphiQL is an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and
  # testing GraphQL queries.
  #
  # Type queries into this side of the screen
  #
  # GraphQL queries typically start with a "{" character. Lines that start
  # with a # are ignored.
  #
  # Buttons will become active as you provide baseurl and query information
  #
  # An example GraphQL query might look like:
  #
  #     {
  #       field(arg: "value") {
  #         subField
  #       }
  #     }
  #
  `;
